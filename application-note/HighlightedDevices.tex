%This just needs to be a bulleted list of what parts you used (not including passive components) with just a quick blurb of what it is doing in your system.
\begin{itemize}
    \item MSP430G2553 processor (on MSP430G2ET development board): processes serial data and creates PWM signal for LEDs
    \item RGB LED: lights up in a combination of the three primary colors (red, green, and blue) corresponding to the PWM signals received from the MSP
    \item USB-to-serial cable: contains FTDI chip that allows the USB port of a computer to communicate with the MSP's UART interface
\end{itemize}
