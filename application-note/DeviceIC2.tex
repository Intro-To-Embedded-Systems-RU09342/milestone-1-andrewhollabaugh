The RGB LED contains three single-color LEDs, one for each primary color (red, green and blue). Therefore, it can be viewed as three separate LEDs for simplicity. The RGB LED has four pins: one is ground, and the other three are positive voltages for each LED. The LEDs are connected to the MSP430 via digital PWM output pins and a series resistor. The series resistors were calculated to be 60 Ohms, using the forward voltages of the LEDs.
